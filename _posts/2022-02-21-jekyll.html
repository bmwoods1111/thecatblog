<p> I think if I were to play around with Jekyll , I would get the hang of it more
    but it is sometimes confusing and has been slightly finicky on my Macbook.  I think 
    it would be great to use more often though.</p>

    <p> Harp didn't want to install correctlly on my Mac so I cannot compare it to Jekyll.
        But, I am pretty sure that I will like Jekyll ore because at least it installed correctly.
