<p>In my 30's.  Mom.  Wife.  Sister.  Friend.  ect....</p>
<p> Took time off from classes due to bad car wreck in 2015.</p>
<p> Resumed classes in Spring 2021</p>
<p> Am really hoping that this will be my last semester and no other classes just 
    "magically" need to be taken</p>
<p>Currently split time between Idaho and Nevada for my husbands job.  Additionally, we 
    get to travel more as a family because of his job</p>
